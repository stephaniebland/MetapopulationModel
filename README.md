# MetapopulationModel
 Metapopulation Model I worked on with Professor Benjamin Gilbert in 2012-2013

 This code was written a long time ago; before I knew about version control or Tidyverse.

 The only things that matter in this repository are:

 - [Modified Model Code12](Metapopulation%20R%20Code/Modified%20Model%20Code12.r) The most up to date code for producing metapopulations.

- [GilbertmetapopulationEEB497.pdf](Metapopulation%20R%20Code/GilbertmetapopulationEEB497.pdf) The final report for my independent project.
